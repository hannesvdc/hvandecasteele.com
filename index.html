        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am Hannes Vandecasteele, a <em>postdoctoral research fellow</em> at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Johns Hopkins University (JHU). I also hold a second
            appointment at the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at JHU. My advisor is Ioannis Kekvrekidis.
            My current research focuses on developing machine learning algorithms for s scientific computing, and specificaly for computational chemistry. 
            integrating machine learning and advanced mathematical techniques to address challenges in drug discovery.
        </p>

        <p>
            Previously, I worked on micro-macro Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for multiscale molecular dynamics, micro-macro acceleration for stochastic 
            differential equations with a time-scale separation, and reaction-path continuation methods for chemical systems. Now, I am leveraging my expertise in machine learning for scientific computing 
            to push the boundaries of what computational tools can achieve in the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            I earned my PhD from KU Leuven in Belgium in 2023. My professional journey has also included working as a software engineer at Facebook where I developed physics engines for virtual reality applications.
        </p>
